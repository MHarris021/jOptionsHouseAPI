jOptionsHouseAPI
================

Java Library for using the OptionsHouse trading API


#### Dependencies ####
GSON library for parsing JSON in Java (https://code.google.com/p/google-gson/)

#### Notes ####
* OptionsHouse requires you to sign their API agreement before using the trading API
* OptionsHouse asks you to only send 1 API message per second.  They reserve the 
  right to revoke your API access if you bombard their servers with requests (in
  excess of 1 message per second.)
* This software is provided AS-IS with NO WARRANTY.  Please practice with a virtual trading
  account before using it for real.  Please let me know of any bugs you find!  I have done
  my best to try to make the library accurate and error-free, but I can't provide any
  guarantees!
